WPClipart collection: clipart and photos optimized for use with word processors and inkjet printers.
Images may be used for commercial as well as personal projects without attribution or linking.
See the Legal page for complete details concerning their Terms of Use.

Terms of Use

      These images are public domain, and that means they can be used and edited for whatever purpose you wish, personal or commercial. No attrribution or linking is required. There are only two modest exceptions to being able to do anything at all with any of the images . . .


Exceptions

        * A small percentage of the clipart consists of Company logos, recognizable hardware and postage stamp art, which are not formally PD but are available via Fair Use, which means that they are actually copyrighted but can be used without the owner's permission in many situations.

          Small credit-card reproductions to use on a website or flier are examples of Fair Use -- but you should realize that you cannot do something like make your own company logo based upon one of the Fair Use items.

        * My website is mine. I do not expect anyone to copy my site or the image collection (in large part) to host online or sell. This would compete with my site, draining what revenue I generate through online ads. These pay for hosting and modestly compensate me all the ink I use in test printing and for the hundreds of hours I spend finding, creating and editing images.

          The entire collection, however, is freely downloadable. 


Efforts

      I was amazed by the roadblocks presented to anyone trying to put together a collection of Public Domain (PD) clipart such as this. With all the stuff floating around, most everyplace has restrictions. The last straw for me was a "teacher's helper" site that had obviously copied from the World Factbook (maps) -- in the process inflating the image sizes yet diminishing their quality -- and then had the gall to put restrictions on their use.


Origins

      Every scrap of clipart here that I did not create was posted clearly as free for private and commercial use and free of any other restrictions. If it required so much as an attribution, a link or a postcard -- I did not use it.

      When I found clipart/photos on a site that did not list the origin of the images, (despite the claim of PD status) I would search for the images elsewhere to make sure they were available for PD use. Much to my frustration, this often led to the discovery that the images were posted elsewhere on the internet, with restrictions of use upon them.

      Did these other sites with the restrictions on the images have the rights to these images? In many cases this is doubtful, but without verification of the images origin, I must give the benefit of the doubt. I have emailed several of these sites owners/contacts, but only once out of my last 30-40 letters did I recieve a reply.

      [NOTE: I considered listing these questionable sites to help track down the origin of images, but the fact of the matter is -- the images were created by somebody, and I think it safe to assume that at least a few of the sites in question have legitimate claim to image copyright. Therefore, I do not wish to blindly name these site with the others, and therefore unjustly cast aspersions . . . ]
