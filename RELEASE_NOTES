Version History:
----------------

Release 0.95
------------

 * Replaced dependency on java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream, which is only available in Java 1.6.
 * Added a unit test around reading and writing images in every format.
 * We now sort some (but not all) GIF color tables.
 * Applied the BMP "buffer flushing" bug to the PBM reading and writing code.
 * Fixed a regression around flushing the bit buffer when writing BMPs with very small palettes.
 * Removed assumption about DataBuffer type when reading BMPs.
 * When writing a GIF, we now always include a Graphic Control Extension block, even if its not necessary.
 * We are more defensive about missing GCEs.
 * Lastly, we now set a minimum bound on initial code sizes for LZW-compressed Gif image data.
 * Found a regression in writing TIFFs around strip offsets being properly updated.  Not a LZW issue after all.
	Added a few unit tests around this issue.
